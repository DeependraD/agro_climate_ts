# Analysis of Timeseries data concerning Agroclimate
The repo is meant to contain datasets and scripts, mainly R, used for time series analysis of Agroclimate and Wheat phenotype data.

Some links that might help a researcher looking for weather dataset may be served by following:

1. An ftp server that contains the list of weather stations as of May 11, 2017 

 ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/noaa/isd-history.txt

- To obtain the weather station details specific to Nepal please refer to Stations_Nepal.txt file inside data subdirectory (It's an excerpt from the above stated link actually).

[This](https://ropensci.org/blog/blog/2017/04/04/gsodr) link is a great read too. A plant disease modeller shares his experience with handling geospatial and weather data. It relates mostly to the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI 1) providing of several sources of data, one of which being the Global Surface Summary of the Day (GSOD) data. The GSOD and a package- GSODR, that has routines for managing the database retrieved from the GSOD archive, are extensively discussed by the author. 

For now nothing, not even remotely, relates to phenotype data analysis of wheat. I do, however after completion of my thesis, plan to make publicly available the dataset as well as the scripts that I used while analysing the my experimental data.
